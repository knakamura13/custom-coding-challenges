    "# Fundamental Algorithm #4: Sliding Window\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sliding Window technique is a method for efficiently solving problems that involve arrays or strings by maintaining a subset of elements within a window frame over the data structure. It's commonly used in problems that require finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., maximum/minimum sums, unique elements, matching patterns). Variants include fixed-size windows, dynamic windows that expand and contract, and techniques for handling edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** variables to track the window's start and end positions, as well as any other required data (e.g., current sum, character counts).\n",
    "2. **Iterate** over the array or string using a loop:\n",
    "   - **Expand** the window by moving the end pointer.\n",
    "   - **Update** the state (e.g., add the new element to the current sum).\n",
    "   - **Check** if the current window satisfies the problem's condition.\n",
    "   - **If necessary**, **shrink** the window by moving the start pointer and update the state accordingly.\n",
    "3. **Repeat** until the end of the array or string is reached.\n",
    "4. **Return** the result based on the problem's requirement (e.g., maximum sum, indices of the window).\n",
