    "# Fundamental Algorithm #3: Breadth First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (often called the 'root') and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is commonly used in problems that require finding the shortest path, level-order traversal, or checking connectivity in graphs. Variants include BFS on weighted graphs and modifications like Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest paths.\n",

    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "- Using a queue is essential to explore nodes level by level.\n",
    "- Modifying BFS to store paths allows retrieval of the actual shortest path, not just its length.\n",
    "- BFS can be adapted for various problems like level-order traversal, checking bipartiteness, and finding connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Case Handling:**\n",
    "  - Ensure the graph does not contain cycles that could cause infinite loops if nodes are not marked as visited.\n",
    "  - Handle disconnected graphs appropriately.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Variants of BFS:**\n",
    "  - **Weighted Graphs:** For graphs with weights, algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm are used instead.\n",
    "  - **Bidirectional BFS:** For finding the shortest path between two nodes more efficiently by simultaneously exploring from both nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pitfalls and Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visited Nodes:** Always mark nodes as visited when they are enqueued, not when dequeued, to prevent multiple enqueues of the same node.\n",
    "- **Queue Implementation:** Use `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** Be mindful of the increased space usage in BFS compared to DFS, especially in graphs with high branching factors.\n",
