    "# Fundamental Algorithm #2: Depth First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (often called the 'root') and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is commonly used in problems that require visiting all nodes in a graph, checking for cycles, or finding connected components. Variants include iterative and recursive implementations, and specialized versions like Topological Sort or Tarjan's Algorithm for strongly connected components.\n",

    "**Algorithm Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive DFS**:\n",
    "   - Start from the root node.\n",
    "   - Mark the current node as visited.\n",
    "   - For each adjacent node, if it hasn't been visited, recursively perform DFS on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative DFS**:\n",
    "   - Use a stack to manage the nodes.\n",
    "   - Initialize the stack with the root node.\n",
    "   - While the stack is not empty:\n",
    "     - Pop a node from the stack.\n",
    "     - If the node hasn't been visited:\n",
    "       - Mark it as visited.\n",
    "       - Push all adjacent unvisited nodes onto the stack.\n",
