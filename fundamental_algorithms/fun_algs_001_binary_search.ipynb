    "# Fundamental Algorithm #1: Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It's commonly used in coding problems that require searching for elements, determining insertion points, or finding boundary conditions in sorted data. Common variants include searches for the first or last occurrence of a target and finding the smallest or largest element that satisfies a given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Implementation**\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end indices of the array.\n",
    "2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, perform the following steps:\n",
    "   1. Calculate the middle index `mid` as `left + (right - left) // 2`.\n",
    "   2. Compare the target value to the element at `mid`.\n",
    "   3. If the target equals the element at `mid`, return `mid`.\n",
    "   4. If the target is less than the element at `mid`, set `right = mid - 1` to focus on the left half.\n",
    "   5. If the target is greater than the element at `mid`, set `left = mid + 1` to focus on the right half.\n",
    "3. If the target is not found after the loop ends, return an indicator of failure (e.g., `-1`).\n",

    "    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1  # Initialize pointers\n",
    "    while left <= right:\n",

    "- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The search space is halved with each iteration.\n",
