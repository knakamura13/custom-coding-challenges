Given an array A of N integers, write a function that returns the smallest positive integer that does not occur in A.

Examples:

- `[1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]` should return `5`.
- `[1, 2, 3]` should return `4`.
- `[−1, −3]` should return `1`.

Input Constraints:

- N is an integer within the range `[1...100,000]`
- Each element of array A is an integer within the range `[−1,000,000...1,000,000]`
